- [ ] Major module: Introduce an AI opponent.
In this major module, the objective is to incorporate an AI player into the game.
Notably, the use of the A* algorithm is not permitted for this task. Key features
and goals include:
    - [ ] Develop an AI opponent that provides a challenging and engaging gameplay
    experience for users.

    mentation, you must simulate keyboard input. The constraint here is that
    the AI can only refresh its view of the game once per second, requiring it to
    anticipate bounces and other actions.
    The AI must utilize power-ups if you have chosen to implement the
    Game customization options module.
    - [ ] Implement AI logic and decision-making processes that enable the AI player
    to make intelligent and strategic moves.
    - [ ] Explore alternative algorithms and techniques to create an effective AI player
    without relying on A*.
    - [ ] Ensure that the AI adapts to different gameplay scenarios and user interac-
    tions.
    You will need to explain in detail how your AI works during your
    evaluation. Creating an AI that does nothing is strictly prohibited;
    it must have the capability to win occasionally.
    This major module aims to enhance the game by introducing an AI opponent that
    adds excitement and competitiveness without relying on the A* algorithm.
